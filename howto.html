      The goal of this project is to map out "effective" coverage of the Puget MeshCore mesh.
      The client app will already tell you whether a repeater heard your message, but that
      doesn't really tell you much. Did it actually go anywhere? Did anyone else receive it?
      By using MQTT data from prominent observer nodes, this helps visualize that places
      where a sent message will be widely received.

      <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank" href="/">The coverage map</a>
      is a crowd-sourced visualization of repeater coverage in the PNW MeshCore mesh.
    </div>

    <div>
      The main map has a few features:
      <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
        <li>Dots indicate "pings" or "samples" from wardrivers.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">
          <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
            <li>Pings are visible on the map for 1 day before being grouped into a "coverage"
              tile (a box).</li>
            <li>Green dot - a ping was "observed" (by MQTT) at that location.</li>
            <li>Orange dot - a repeater was heard but the ping was not observed.</li>
            <li>Red dot - a ping was lost.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Coverage tiles hold stats for the last 15 "groupings" of pings.</li>
        <li style="list-style-type: none">
          <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
            <li>Green box - the mesh was reachable in this region.</li>
            <li>Orange box - the mesh was not reachable, but pings were heard in this region.</li>
            <li>Red box - the mesh was not reachable in this region.</li>
          </ul>
        </li>
        <li>Dashed line - links a green dot or box to its 1st hop repeater(s).</li>
        <li>Blue dot - repeater with an advert in the past 1 day.</li>
        <li>Light gray dot - repeater with an advert in the past 5 days.</li>
        <li>Dark gray dot - repeater without an advert in the past 5 days.</li>
      </ul>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">How it works</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    You send your location to #wardrive in the format "lat.xxxx lon.yyyy".
    If the bot receives your location, a new point is added to the map indicating
    you can reach the mesh at that spot. If you want to also log places where you
    can't reach the mesh, there's a helpful web app you can run on your phone to
    automate the process. To be "heard", your message repeats must be heard by
    PugetMesh Haystack [86], WW7STR/PugetMesh Cougar [7e], or N7JMV-NEW-RP [53].

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">How you can contribute</h2>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    The easiest way to contribute is to use the
    <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank" href="/wardrive">Wardrive app</a>.
    It allows you to connect to your companion radio and send ping messages
    automatically. It also sends your ping location to the service so that
    misses are also automatically logged. You can send single pings or enable
    'auto mode' which will send a ping when you enter a coverage tile that hasn't
    been updated recently.
  </div>

  <h3 class="mb-2 pl-4 text-lg text-slate-100">Using the Wardrive app</h3>
  <div class="mb-2 pl-4 text-base">
    It mostly "just works", but there are few things to know when using the app.
    <ul class="mb-2 pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
      <li>You must allow access to Bluetooth and Location in your browser.</li>
      <li>Your companion radio must add the #wardrive channel. The app will help with that.</li>
      <li>It does not work in Safari.
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>On Macos, use Edge or Chrome.</li>
          <li>On iOS, use the <a class="underline text-sky-300" target="_blank"
              href="https://apps.apple.com/us/app/bluefy-web-ble-browser/id1492822055">Bluefy app</a></li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>You have to disconnect from the MeshCore app in order to connect to your radio. BLE only allows one
        connection.</li>
      <li>If you're using auto mode, the web page must be in the foreground and the screen unlocked.
        <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
          <li>It tries to keep the screen alive while running, but I've only tested on iOS.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li>Auto mode checks every 10 seconds if you're in a coverage tile that needs an update and only sends a ping if
        needed (hasn't already been pinged in the past day).</li>
      <li>Don't spam the mesh or the service. The mesh is a shared resource -- be judicious.</li>
      <li><b>If you're using a mobile repeater (car-peater), use the "ignore id" function to exclude it from the path.
          Otherwise coverage data will be inaccurate.</b></li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">Host an instance for your region?</h2>
  <div class="pl-4 text-base mb-2">
    If you want to set up an instance for your region you have two good options.
    <ul class="pl-4 text-sm list-disc">
      <li>Host your own Cloudflare version by following the

          target="_blank">setup instructions</a>.

  <h2 class="mb-2 text-xl text-slate-100">Privacy</h2>
  <div class="pl-4 text-base">
    The only thing the service stores is the location you send to #wardrive and the id of the 1st hop repeater.
    The web app sends your location to #wardrive and to the service. That's it. Logging on the web app is stored
    locally. You will be sending your companion radio's name with your location to #wardrive which is a public channel.
